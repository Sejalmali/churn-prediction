Here is the `README.md` file specifically for the **Churn Prediction** project:

---

# Churn Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict customer churn. The Jupyter Notebook walks through data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to build a robust churn prediction model.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing for churn datasets.
- Feature selection and engineering to optimize model performance.
- Application of various machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-prediction.git
   cd churn-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Churn_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Train machine learning models for churn prediction.
   - Evaluate and interpret the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about customer activity and behavior. Ensure that the dataset is in the appropriate format and placed in the working directory before running the notebook.
